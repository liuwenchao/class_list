## test from SeedLinkTech

In our project, there is a page which lists students in a class. Please implement the html and ajax call to get and display classes’ name and students’ name with avatar. You can find the design in attachment and get the json data from [Here](http://42.121.35.233:9001/school/api/v1/class/my/?format=json&username=super&api_key=123456)
 
Here are some basic requirements:

1. Please create a simple Django Project to host your code.
1. Please develop css based on flat-ui.
1. Select proper js framework as Django views can easily work with.
1. Please use github to manage your code development.
1. In github, there should be at least 2 phrases(branches). Please leave the merged branches there.
1. Please use django block to isolate each part.
1. Please use django i18n mechanics to tag the texts for translation.
1. Submit by end of tomorrow. 23:00 (GMT +8)

### Notes

1. Home icon is different from the requirement image, I used the one from bootstrap as flat-ui doesn't have one.
1. A live demo is available at: [https://test_django-c9-lliu.c9.io/](https://test_django-c9-lliu.c9.io/) , contact me if it's down.
